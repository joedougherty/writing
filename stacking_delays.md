## Stacking Delays ##

I wanted to jot down some notes of trying some ideas like these https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBsRmJ4QHwM using the Line 6 Pod HD500X.


### Multitudes ###

From left to right:

#### Before Amp ####

* Noise Gate (default)
* Preamp+EQ -- Studio EQ (GAIN: +12.0) [I'm using this as a clean boost. YMMV]
* Dynamic Delay (TIME: 333ms)
* Stereo Delay (L TIME: 333ms R TIME: 666ms)

#### Amp ####

(I chose a stereo amp setup, but mono might work too if you don't have the requisite patience at the time.)

Left amp:

* Amp: Solo 100 Clean
* Cab: 412 Greenback 25 
* Mic: 57 Off XS

Amp settings:

* All settings (drive, bass, mid, etc. around 30-40%, except for volume at 90-95%)

Right amp:

* Same amp/combo. Try a different mic to expand your sound. Currently using the 421 Dynamic on the right side.

#### After Amp ####

* Reverb -- Octo (DECAY: 67% PREDELAY: 14ms TONE: 100% MIX:52%)
* Lo Res Delay (TIME: 1998ms)
* Tape Echo Dry (TIME: 666ms)
* Volume Pedal
