I wanted to jot down some notes on a Line6 Pod HD500X single-amp patch I use all the time.


### TREAD SIMPLY ###

Here are the EQ settings:

Going back to the inital image, take a closer look at its attributues.

Note that the numbers **1**,**2**,**3**,**4** in the image correspond to the physical knobs that appear below them on the unit.


* **1**: cycle through the amp choices
* **2**: cycle through the cab choices
* **3**: cycle through the mic choices
* **4**: I haven't understood this one yet.


There are a few effects blocks I put in front of this amp. They are, in order from left to right:

* Noise gate (Hard Gate)
* Boost Compression 
* Tube Drive
* Volume Pedal


#### Noise Gate ####

**ESSENTIAL. DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT.**

Use knob 2 to select "HARD GATE". It should be the first option after "NOISE GATE". 

The default Open Threshold and -65.0 settings have worked fine for me.


#### Boost Compression ####

Keep it tight. I like the following settings:

* DRIVE:    50%
* BASS:     50%
* COMP:     31%
* TREBLE:   50%
* OUTPUT:   58%


#### Tube Drive ####

(Think, Tubescreamer.) Add some grit!


* DRIVE:    46%
* BASS:     53%
* MID:      50%
* TREBLE:   50%
* OUTPUT:   82%


#### Volume Pedal ####

Self-explanatory.
